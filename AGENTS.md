# webjars-locator

RequireJS support for WebJars (`org.webjars:webjars-locator`), wrapping webjars-locator-core. Published to Maven Central.

Follow the `zen-of-projects` Skill (extract it with `./mvnw -q skillsjars:extract`); this file records
only project-specific facts and exceptions.

## Skills

`zen-of-projects`, `zen-of-james` (from `com.jamesward:skills`, extracted to the gitignored `.kiro/skills/`).

## MCP

`javadocs` (https://www.javadocs.dev/mcp), configured in `.mcp.json` / `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` and
approved in `.claude/settings.json`. Use its `get_latest_version` for version lookups and its
source/doc tools for API questions. In Claude Code its tools are deferred: load them with ToolSearch
(search `javadocs`).

## Build & test

- Full validation: `./mvnw -B -ntp verify`.

## Maintenance routine

`.factory/MAINTENANCE.md` (weekly), following the `zen-of-projects` Skill.

## Exceptions to zen-of-projects

- **Old Java target:** The bytecode target is Java 8 (`maven-compiler-plugin` `<source>`/`<target>` 1.8) and CI builds and tests on Java 11, because existing applications on old JDKs still depend on this library. Don't raise the Java version or the bytecode target in the maintenance routine; label the PR `needs-human` if a dependency update requires it.
- **Releases:** never run a release or deploy in the maintenance routine.
